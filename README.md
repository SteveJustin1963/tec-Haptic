# tec-Haptic

### Haptic communication interfaces for the tec-1

A simple haptic communication interface is an interface that allows two devices to communicate with each other using haptic feedback. Haptic feedback is a type of feedback that uses the sense of touch to communicate with a user. It can be used to provide information about the status of a system, to give feedback about the user's actions, or to provide a way for the user to interact with the system.

## input
The input is collected through a variety of sensors that are placed on the body. These sensors can be used to detect a variety of information, such as the user's  

## movement of a human finger
There are a variety of different sensors that can be used to detect the movement of a human finger. Some of the most common sensors include 

- movements sensor, 
- accelerometers, 
- gyroscopes, 
- magnetometers. 
- pressure sensor
- temperature sensor on skin



### variable resistor be used? 

But the simplest is to use a variable resistor such as 
- flex strip. 
- for example https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/flex-sensor-hookup-guide/all. 
When is unbent its around 30k ohms when bent it increases to around 70k ohms. 
"The simplest way to incorporate this sensor into your project is by using it in a voltage divider. 
This circuit requires one resistor. 
Many values from 10KΩ to 100KΩ will work. 
If you have a resistor kit, you may want to introduce some trial-and-error to hone in on that perfect static resistance. 
A value between the minimum and maximum resistance values is usually a good choice. We'll use a 47kΩ resistor in this example"

- capacitive sensor 
make by taking two strands of insulated magnetic wire like used I transformers, and coiling them around a skewer stick at say 45 degree or less pitch. Then slide out the skewer, the stiffness in the wire should hold its shape. Dip into liquid latex or similar and let drip dry. When you flex this rubber shaft then C will vary. When fed through a circuit can produce a variable frequency or voltage then into an ADC. 

## output
There are a variety of different types of output that can be used in a haptic communication interface. These include 
- vibration, 
- pressure, 
- temperature, 
- force feedback.

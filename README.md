# tec-Haptic

### haptic communication interfaces for the tec-1

A simple haptic communication interface is an interface that allows two devices to communicate with each other using haptic feedback. Haptic feedback is a type of feedback that uses the sense of touch to communicate with a user. It can be used to provide information about the status of a system, to give feedback about the user's actions, or to provide a way for the user to interact with the system.

### how is the input collected?
The input is collected through a variety of sensors that are placed on the body. These sensors can be used to detect a variety of information, such as the user's movements, the pressure that they are exerting, and the temperature of skin, etc. There are a variety of different types of output that can be used in a haptic communication interface. These include vibration, pressure, temperature, and force feedback. 

There are a variety of different sensors that can be used to detect the movement of a human finger. Some of the most common sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. can a variable resistor be used? But the simplest is to use a variable resistor such as flex strip. for example https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/flex-sensor-hookup-guide/all. when is unbent its around 30k ohms when bent it increases to around 70k ohms. "The simplest way to incorporate this sensor into your project is by using it in a voltage divider. This circuit requires one resistor. Many values from 10KΩ to 100KΩ will work. If you have a resistor kit, you may want to introduce some trial-and-error to hone in on that perfect static resistance. A value between the minimum and maximum resistance values is usually a good choice. We'll use a 47kΩ resistor in this example"
